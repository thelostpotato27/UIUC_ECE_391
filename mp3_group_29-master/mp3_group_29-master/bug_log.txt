-------------------------------------------------

Dated Discovered: 10/16/2022
Error: Crash after boot sequence
Description:
OS crashes immediately after boot sequence, regardless
of code run in kernel.c. Due to a paging error, improper
initialization due to initializing wrong bit to turn on
4MB pages (accidentally set bit 3 instead of bit 4).

Date Discovered: 10/16/2022
Error: interrupts not clearing
Description:
Interrupts did not end successfully. Due to faulty send_eoi() function
writing to the wrong port on the PIC (offset by 1).

Date Discovered: 10/16/2022
Error: Keyboard presses print wrong characters to screen
Description:
Forgot to convert scanned data from keyboard into the corresponding
character, causing the wrong characters to be printed. Error resolved
by using array to map the scanned data to the corresponding character.

Date Discovered: 10/16/2022
Error: init_page was just crashing every time it was run
Description: 
the code was turning on the wrong bit in %cr4. instead of bit 4, it was setting bit 3 to 1. Also, video mem index in the page table was wrong, it wasn't the same as the video mem address in physical mem. matching the video mem index to the video mem physical address made it work.

Date Discovered: 10/16/2022
Error: For some reason, test results came back in the wrong order and we weren't sure if it was indicative of a deeper issue
Description: 
that's just how the visualization works in the kernal, if there's no more space it loops back around

Date Discovered: 10/17/2022
Error: Keyboard registers multiple keypresses for one keypress
Description:
This was due to a corrupted image file, and also because the keyboard sends data for key up and key down.

Date Discovered: 10/17/2022
Error: PIC wrong initialization for secondary PIC
Description:
Secondary PIC was initialized incorrectly because it was attempting to write
to main PIC, resulting in failed writes. Resolved by changing name to write
to secondary when intializing secondary PIC and ensuring command port was
selected before data port was written to.

Date Discovered: 10/23/2022
Error: terminal_read infinite loop
Description:
terminal_read test failed due to infinite loop, needed to update enter_pressed
to be able to read user input. Fixed by modifying enter_pressed case for keyboard
to set flag.

Date Discovered: 10/23/2022
Error: RTC interrupt only happening once
Description: RTC interrupt would not happen at regular frequency. Issue turned out to be writing ICW4
to main rather than secondary PIC.

Date Discovered: 10/23/2022
Error: read_data not writing to buffer
Description: Combination of getting the incorrect starting address as well as inefficient memcpy from block
resulted in buffer not being written to properly. Once code modified to print blocks, the function worked.

Date Discovered: 11/7/2022
Error: incompatible file operation type
Description: Had wrong function signature for file read and write. Changed bytes to be same type as open.

Date Discovered: 11/7/2022
Error: Execute not running program
Description: Execute terminates successfully but does not run program, disallows interrupts.

Date Discovered: 11/7/2022
Error: Page fault in context switch of Execute
Description: Page fault occurring at iret step of context_switch in paging due to incorrect stack setup.

Date Discovered: 11/21/2022
Error: Multiple sources of page fault in execute
Description: Many things were not initialized properly, no space allocated for video memory in paging,
paging done improperly, accidental usage of uninitilized PCB instead of terminal's PCB, and incorrect
EIP being loaded due to bug in read_data.

Date Discovered: 11/28/2022
Error: Pingpong causing cursor to go to bottom, messes up buffer
Description: error in putc function in lib.c that was causing the executing terminal to update
the cursor in the displayed terminal, rather than putc to only update cursor in displayed terminal.

Date Discovered: 11/30/2022
Error: Pingpong prints to wrong screen
Description: forgot to run reset_vidmem when switching terminals, resulting sometimes in RTC
printing to wrong screen due to race condition.
